# How to sample subgraphs
Given a graph G = (V,E) where E are directed edges, how can we sample a random subgraph?


## Uniformly delete nodes
One way to sample a subgraph is to uniformly delete nodes from the graph. 
We have N nodes in the graph, and we want to sample a subgraph with N'<N nodes. 
We must delete N-N' nodes
- Optional: Specify nodes that cannot be deleted
## Random Walk Idea
Start a rando


# Generating Source Destination Pairs randomly
Given a graph G = (V,E), we want to generate K sets of source destination pairs



# Sampling Variables
N' = Number of nodes in the subgraph
K = Number of source-destination pairs
min_hop = Minimum number of hops between source and destination
arrival_rates = Arrival rates of the source-destination pairs
