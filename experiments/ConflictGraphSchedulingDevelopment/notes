We have to handle non-batched data e.g. a single environment in a single timestep
and batched data e.g. multiple environments in a single timestep or a batch of data from a single environment

torchrl handles batches of data by stacking tensors along the batch dimension
pytorch_geometric handles batches of data by creating a super graph with disconnected edges between different graphs

So how should data be stored? Probably in a dense reprensation with stacks, and then everytime we need to pass a batch
of data through a GNN we convert to a pyg batch object
Best case scenario would be to store everything as a pyg data object
