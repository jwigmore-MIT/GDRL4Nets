Purpose of experiment18 is to demonstrate switch-type optimal policy for the two-node single hop CMP.  

Steps:
1. Find 6 environments that are stabilizing for the two-node single hop CMDP. It should look like the following:

X_p = [0.4, 0.4], Y_p = [0.7, 0.7]
X_p = [0.45, 0.4], Y_p = [0.7, 0.7]
X_p = [0.35, 0.4], Y_p = [0.7, 0.7]
X_p = [0.4, 0.4], Y_p = [0.8, 0.7]
X_p = [0.4, 0.4], Y_p = [0.6, 0.7]
